## Life Summary

Liudolf took after his father in many ways. Thought Otto's attempts at converting Liudolf to the Shia faith failed, Liudolf eventually found his way to the Assassins on his own.

He first tried to join Lucifer's Own, participating in their dark rituals and submitting himself to the dark lord. However, he grew impatient. His kingdom was in disarray and he needed power NOW.

So, he left Lucifer's Own and decided to wait passively. Later, he found out about his father's involvement with the assassin's and how instrumental it was to maintaining their House's power.

He now realized that his father's seemingly foolish attempts at reading the Koran to him during his childhood had a purpose. He decided to follow in Otto's footsteps and joined the assassins. 

As a price for the joining ritual, he murdered his uncle, Bruno, the Spymaster of the Holy Roman Empire at the time. Later on, however, he grew impatient yet again, desperately needing outside aid to whip his subjects into shape.

He decided to openly practice the Shia faith. However, his subjects did not take too kindly to this. He was forced to renounce his Shia faith and effectively got kicked out of the assassins.

He later returned to the asssassins, this time practicing the Shia faith in secret. For this, he had to murder his wife as part of the joining ritual. He had no qualms about this and murdered her in cold blood.

Decades later, he ruled the Holy Roman Empire with an iron fist, with a handful of Kings as his vassals. He attained Grandmaster status and sent his assassin sons off to do his bidding.


Liudolf successfully converted four of his children into the Shia faith. His two sons, one of whom became the head of a mercenary company and one of his daughters. Two of his sons were successfully inducted into the society of Assassins. In fact, his son Otto killed his older brother as part of the induction ceremonies. Otto went on to head the royal mercenary band. His son Liudolf however, was imprisoned by the King Ernst of Romagna during his attempt to assassinate the king under the orders of his father. The younger Liudolf eventually died at the age of 31 in the dungeons. 

## Death

Eventually, he gave ghost during his late 50s, dying infirm as did his father before him. Like his father, he was known as a raving madman who would kill anyone to get his way.

His firstborn son, Emelrich, took on the empire. Little did Emelrich know, the majority of his siblings had been secretly practicing the Shia faith...
