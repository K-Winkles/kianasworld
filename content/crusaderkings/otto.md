Today I played as King Otto of Germany. I joined the society of Assassins and secretly converted into the Shia faith. I killed countless people, family (especially brothers and cousins), my first (cheating) wife, and dissenters to my rule to get everything I wanted. I also waged multiple wars and quashed peasant rebellions.

I then seized the Kingdom of Italy, formed the Holy Roman Empire, and forced the Pope to become my vassal all at the ripe age of 45.

I'm now in the process of killing off Italian dissenters so that I can enforce the same peace that I had in the Kingdom of Germany.

Otto is drunk on power. And so will his descendants after him.


Kaiser Otto eventually died a villified man. Everyone thought he was raving mad and everyone knew he was a murderer, kinslayer, and tyrant.

Everyone who had ever stood in his way paid dearly! But he launched his House's name into legendary status. It was House Liudolfinger that fell the mightly Kingdom of Italy, usurped Rome, and formed the Holy Roman Empire. 

Though he never reached Grandmaster Status in the Society of Assassins, his son and heir, Kaiser Liudolf did. Liudolf eventually succeeded where Otto had failed. He had groomed one of his sons to be his protege and successfully converted another into following the great cause.

Hail Kaiser Otto!
