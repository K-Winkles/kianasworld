## Introduction
This is the part where I talk at length about the intricacy of CK2's gameplay.

First and foremost, remember that this is a grand strategy game. Meaning, you are meant to spend hours at a time playing the game. You certainly wouldn't see much progress in the span of just 30 minutes.

If you intend to play the game, you have to allot at least 2 hours of your time to see anything significant.

I personally enjoy setting up schemes at length and then executing them perfectly later on. 

## Points to consider

* Your goal is launch your dynasty into greater and greater heights of prestige.
* It's game over if you lose all of your holdings and get demoted to peasant status.
* You can generally attain your goals of glory by gaining more control of lands and vassals.
* The fun part is that you can take control of more holdings and vassals in a variety of ways. The most straightforward method is to wage war (provided you have a casus belli aka a valid reason). But the more exciting ways include assassination and finding loopholes in the inheritance laws.
