This is the part where I talk at length about the intricacy of CK2's gameplay.

First and foremost, remember that this is a grand strategy game. Meaning, you are meant to spend hours at a time playing the game. You certainly wouldn't see much progress in the span of just 30 minutes.

If you intend to play the game, you have to allot at least 2 hours of your time to see anything significant.

I personally enjoy setting up schemes at length and then executing them perfectly later on. 

So here are the basics of the game:

1. Your goal is launch your dynasty into greater and greater heights of prestige.
2. It's game over if you lose all of your holdings and get demoted to peasant status.
3. You can generally attain your goals of glory by gaining more control of lands and vassals.
4. The fun part is that you can take control of more holdings and vassals in a variety of ways. The most straightforward method is to wage war (provided you have a casus belli aka a valid reason). But the more exciting ways include assassination and finding loopholes in the inheritance laws.
