First thing to remember is that this is a game set in the feudal period. However, your playstyle will be largely influenced by your religion and culture. For instance, if you were to play a Shia character, you would have mechanics that are not available to a Catholic ruler. 

Here are the main religion groups in the world of Crusader Kings 2:
1. Christian
2. Israelite
3. Islam
4. Pagan
5. Mazdan
6. Eastern

Yes, they all branch out into sub-religions.

I personally only play Catholic rulers at the moment because I am not yet satisfied with my level of understanding. My goal is to play a dynasty on Iron Man mode that would span at least 5 generations. If possible, I want to reach the end year (the year CK2 will transition into EU4 because historically, times are supposed to change like that).

Hence, I will be talking largely about Catholic rulers. If you would like to know more about Viking rulers and Shia rulers, kindly check out other resources. To start, you can check out the wiki here: https://crusaderkings-two.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Game_Mechanics.

For Catholic rulers, remember that the pope's ass will need constant licking. Why? He has the power to excommunicate you. Meaning, you are going to be temporarly booted out of the Christian faith unless you "repent" (read: give the pope a huge amount of money).

This is bad because it will give other rulers the power to declare war on you at will. Outwardly for "religious reasons" but in reality it is to take some of your power more than anything.

Speaking of war, you cannot declare war all willy nilly. You need a CASUS BELLI (i.e. a valid reason) which can include the following:

1. You have a legitimate claim to the title
2. You are pressing someone else's legitimate claim (if you win, they get the title and potentially become your vassal)
3. Some territory is yours "by law". In the game it is called a "de jure ducal claim".

Now, let's talk about the law. Land is quite literally everything in this game because land = power (taxes, vassals, levies) 

{{< block tip >}}
A levy pertains to a group of commandable troups. You have your personal levies and the power to raise vassal levies. Depending on the war you are fighting, your vassals might get angry for raising their levies for a long time. However, if you are defending or attacking infidels, they will likely lend you troops for as long as you need without repercussions.

Here are the basic levels of rulership:
1. Emperor
2. King
3. Duke
4. Count
5. Mayor / Bishop

The titles change according to religion, culture, etc. but the basic principle remains the same. 

If you are a King, your liege must be an Emperor. Your vassals will be dukes, counts, mayors, and bishops.

If you are an emperor, you have no liege and you can have vassals that are kings, dukes, counts, mayors, and bishops.

Note that your vassals can have their own vassals as well. 

So if for example you are an emperor and you have a vassal who is a king, the dukes who report to your vassal king do not directly report to you unlike the dukes who are your direct vassals.

Your direct vassals pay taxes to you and you can obligate them to lend you troops at will. However for Bishops, they can choose to pay taxes to you if they like you better than the pope. Otherwise, they will pay taxes to the pope. 

Also note that this applies to PAPAL INVESTITURE (one of the two possible religious tax laws).

{{< block info >}}
The other type of investiture is called FREE INVESTITURE. This means you don't pay taxes to the pope at all and so do your bishops. This means everyone gets paid more taxes in general. However, this will piss the pope off majorly and if he dislikes you enough, he can excommunicate you at will.

Take note that your vassals are going to be very very touchy about the land that you own. For instance, if you have a duke vassal and you own a county within his Duchy, he is going to be very, very salty. 

So take note of which counties and duchies you own and make sure you divide it cleanly amongst your vassals unless you want factions cropping up left and right later on.

Also remember to distribute your ELECTOR TITLES.

An ELECTOR TITLE is defined as a duchy or kingdom that is of a lower tier relative to the character's primary title.

Your vassals will hate it if you own more than two duchies. They will also hate it if you own too many kingdoms.

{{< block tip >}}
What I normally do is I create several kings and control them directly. That way, they won't complain of me holding too many elector titles and I get to lick just a handful of people's asses to get my way.

I am just scratching the surface of gameplay mechanics in this section. If you think this is quite a lot, then I assure you you will be overwhelmed by the entirety of the game. However, if you are like me and you love understanding complicated things, WELCOME TO HEAVEN!!!

What I have covered in the section is enough to give you a good headstart in understanding the game. These are the core mechanics that you need to know to be a successful power player. As you play more, the more it will become second nature.
