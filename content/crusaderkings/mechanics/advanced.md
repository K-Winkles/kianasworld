So here's the world map... They say CK2 is nothing but an elaborate coloring game...

![Worldmap](/worldmap.jpg)

And they're right. 

## Introduction

First thing to remember is that this is a game set in the feudal period. However, your playstyle will be largely influenced by your religion and culture. For instance, if you were to play a Shia character, you would have mechanics that are not available to a Catholic ruler. 

Religion is a major thing in the game because it influences virtually all of your decisions. In fact, rubbing elbows with the religious authorities from the pope down to the bishops is highly advantageous.

Here are the main religion groups in the world of Crusader Kings 2:
* Christian
* Israelite
* Islam
* Pagan
* Mazdan
* Eastern

Yes, they all branch out into sub-religions. 

## Religion
I personally only play Catholic rulers at the moment because I am not yet satisfied with my level of understanding. My goal is to play a dynasty on Iron Man mode that would span at least 5 generations. If possible, I want to reach the end year (the year CK2 will transition into EU4 because historically, times are supposed to change like that).

Hence, I will be talking largely about Catholic rulers. If you would like to know more about Viking rulers and Shia rulers, kindly check out other resources. To start, you can check out the wiki here: https://crusaderkings-two.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Game_Mechanics.


For Catholic rulers, remember that the pope's ass will need constant licking. Why? He has the power to excommunicate you. Meaning, you are going to be temporarly booted out of the Christian faith unless you "repent" (read: give the pope a huge amount of money).

This is bad because it will give other rulers the power to declare war on you at will. Outwardly for "religious reasons" but in reality it is to take some of your power more than anything.

### The Pope and the Anti-pope

Take note that you have the power to support a religious vassal into having a set in the College of Cardinals. That is, the Pope's cronies. 

If you successfully bribe enough people and raise the desirability of your candidate, he might one day become pope once the current pope dies. 

The good thing about this is that if he becomes pope, he is also technically your vassal and foreer indebted to you. What I'm trying to insinuate is that you will be able to have anyone excommunicated.

#### Anti Pope 

However, the easier and cheaper route is to install an anti-pope!

Here are the conditions to creating an anti-pope:

* the ruler is independent and at least duke tier
* the ruler does not control the true pope
* the ruler can spend 500 Prestige
* the bishop is at least count tier
* the bishop is not subject to Papal Investiture crown law
* the religion does not have the "Deposed an Antipope" modifier to moral authority (Modifier is applied upon successful Depose Antipope war and lasts 50 years)

The main benefits of having an anti pope is that you can use the anti pope for excommunication and taxation. If you kiss his ass thorougly, he will excommunicate anyone you want and you will also get higher taxes from your religious vassals.
## War and Claims

Speaking of war, you cannot declare war all willy nilly. You need a CASUS BELLI (i.e. a valid reason) which can include the following:

* You have a legitimate claim to the title
* You are pressing someone else's legitimate claim (if you win, they get the title and potentially become your vassal)
* Some territory is yours "by law". In the game it is called a "de jure ducal claim".

Now, let's talk about the law. Land is quite literally everything in this game because land = power (taxes, vassals, levies) 


A levy pertains to a group of commandable troups. You have your personal levies and the power to raise vassal levies. Depending on the war you are fighting, your vassals might get angry for raising their levies for a long time. However, if you are defending or attacking infidels, they will likely lend you troops for as long as you need without repercussions.


### Hierarchy

Here are the basic levels of rulership:
* Emperor
* King
* Duke
* Count
* Mayor / Bishop

![10 Years Later...](/meme2.jpeg)

The titles change according to religion, culture, etc. but the basic principle remains the same. 

If you are a King, your liege must be an Emperor. Your vassals will be dukes, counts, mayors, and bishops.

If you are an emperor, you have no liege and you can have vassals that are kings, dukes, counts, mayors, and bishops.

Note that your vassals can have their own vassals as well. 

So if for example you are an emperor and you have a vassal who is a king, the dukes who report to your vassal king do not directly report to you unlike the dukes who are your direct vassals.

### Vassals, Taxes, and Levies
Your direct vassals pay taxes to you and you can obligate them to lend you troops at will. However for Bishops, they can choose to pay taxes to you if they like you better than the pope. Otherwise, they will pay taxes to the pope. 

#### Investiture Types

From the **[wiki](https://crusaderkings-two.fandom.com/wiki/Investiture)**: Investiture laws is a small set of laws that only apply to Catholics; no other religions will have it. Investiture law decides if the Pope appoints bishops, or if their liege does. This means that if you have Papal Investiture you will be unable to affect who your bishops are. 

### Papal Investiture

* Pope won't make demands
* You are not as vulnerable to excommunication
* Recommended if you do not have the means to set up an anti pope yet

### Free Investiture

* Your vassals are happier
* You get to appoint bishops
* You get to set up an Anti-Pope
  * This is great because you have nigh unlimited excommunication power since you control the anti pope
  * You also have additional control over taxation


#### Distributing Titles
Take note that your vassals are going to be very very touchy about the land that you own. For instance, if you have a duke vassal and you own a county within his Duchy, he is going to be very, very salty. 

So take note of which counties and duchies you own and make sure you divide it cleanly amongst your vassals unless you want factions cropping up left and right later on.

You will also eventually need to decide whether to distribute your titles amongst your sons. They will also throw tantrums at daddy if they grow old without a fiefdom to command.

#### Elector Title

An elector title is defined as a duchy or kingdom that is of a lower tier relative to the character's primary title.

Your vassals will hate it if you own more than two duchies. They will also hate it if you own too many kingdoms.

#### Pro Tip on Title Distribution

What I normally do is I create several kings and control them directly. That way, they won't complain of me holding too many elector titles and I get to lick just a handful of people's asses to get my way.

#### Conclusion: Welcome to the world of Crusader Kings 

I am just scratching the surface of gameplay mechanics in this section. If you think this is quite a lot, then I assure you you will be overwhelmed by the entirety of the game. However, if you are like me and you love understanding complicated things, WELCOME TO HEAVEN!!!

What I have covered in the section is enough to give you a good headstart in understanding the game. These are the core mechanics that you need to know to be a successful power player. As you play more, the more it will become second nature.
