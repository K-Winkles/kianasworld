Liudolf took after his father in many ways. Thought Otto's attempts at converting Liudolf to the Shia faith failed, Liudolf eventually found his way to the Assassins on his own.

He first tried to join Lucifer's Own, participating in their dark rituals and submitting himself to the dark lord. However, he grew impatient. His kingdom was in disarray and he needed power NOW.

So, he left Lucifer's Own and decided to wait passively. Later, he found out about his father's involvement with the assassin's and how instrumental it was to maintaining their House's power.

He now realized that his father's seemingly foolish attempts at reading the Koran to him during his childhood had a purpose. He decided to follow in Otto's footsteps and joined the assassins. 

As a price for the joining ritual, he murdered his uncle, Bruno, the Spymaster of the Holy Roman Empire at the time. Later on, however, he grew impatient yet again, desperately needing outside aid to whip his subjects into shape.

He decided to openly practice the Shia faith. However, his subjects did not take too kindly to this. He was forced to renounce his Shia faith and effectively got kicked out of the assassins.

He later returned to the asssassins, this time practicing the Shia faith in secret. For this, he had to murder his wife as part of the joining ritual. He had no qualms about this and murdered her in cold blood.

Decades later, he rules the Holy Roman Empire with an iron fist, with a handful of Kings as his vassals. He attained Grandmaster status and sent his assassin sons off to do his bidding.
