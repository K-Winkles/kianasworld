I love all things AI, Finance and Spiritual. I am a Software Engineer by profession, a stock investor on the side, and a Tarot card reader at night. 

As a Software Engineer I currently work for Senti AI, a Philippine Start-up that aims to lead the national AI scene. I am also proficient in Python, the essential Data Science/Machine Learning Tech stacks, and Node.js. I prefer working on the backend over working on the frontend.

As a Stock Investor, I am a big fan of Benjamin Grahams notably conservative attitudes. He has pointed out over and over again that people are like sheep who follow the crowd blindly and I personally would not like to be part of the herd. 

As a Tarot Card Reader, I have had a strong intuition and "the sense/s" since I was very young. I decided to turn it into a side business in order to help people and to flex my entrepreneurship skills.
