## Context

Have you ever eaten brownies thinking they were normal brownies? Well it's kinda like that.

As you know, I am very into the mystic. Recently, I had purchased a clear quartz tower along with a Sage and Lavender smudge stick and one piece of Palo Santo.

Refer to the pictures below:

I purchased them because I felt it would add a more ritualistic element to cleansing my inner self and my space. My other mystic friends are avid crystal enthusiasts and their enthusiasm got me intrigued.

### Smudging

From **[this article](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-smudge-your-house-1274692#:~:text=Smudging%20is%20one%20of%20the,connecting%20heaven%2C%20earth%20and%20humanity.)**:

"Smudging is one of the ways to energetically cleanse a space to invite positive energy. When smudging a space, you burn plant material. The smoke fills and purifies the environment.

As the smoke ascends, our wishes and intentions rise and mingle into the universe, connecting heaven, earth and humanity."

It is an **[ancient practice](https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-ancient-traditions/ancient-art-smudging-0010975)** that originated from indigenous tribes. In fact, research shows that the medicinal smoke from a smudge stick can purify the air of 94% of harmful bacteria for up to 24 hours!

So what's not to love?! Whether you believe in its healing properties or not, smudging is an excellent way to add some structure in your daily life and relieve stress. Plus, it smells great.

## So how the heck do you get h*** from smudging?!

So my accidental discovery goes this way... I really liked the smell of the smudge sticks that I held them directly to my nose and kept inhaling them because it smelled so good. 

After about 30 minutes, I start to feel really fuzzy and like my legs are goo... I thought "Oh, this feeling is so familiar..." and then a few minutes later I was totally out of it. I realized "Oh shit. I'm high."

I thought that it might have been all in my head so I decided to keep experimenting. I did it two more times and I kid you not, I watched acid trip videos on loop for about an hour not knowing an hour had passed.

I also had the most vivid dreams that felt like they lasted for hours. 

Turns out, **[certain variants of sage are known hallucinogenics with psychoactive properties!](https://www.wired.com/2007/08/how-hallucinoge/)**

By George, that explained everything. The high that it induces is very similar to that of m*rijuana. 

## Weirdest, best accidental discovery ever

Honestly, I love it. I love the fact that I can get h*gh legally and without having to stress over finding a w**d dealer. 

However, studies also show that smudging should be done sparingly because it may cause respiratory problems. So I will be keeping that in mind. 

Also, smudge sticks are infinitely cheaper than m*rijuana! You get to get h*gh legally and for less!

Try it. You're gonna love it.
