## Overall List 
### [Arc of a Scythe Trilogy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075VHW9KH?ref_=dbs_s_ks_series_rwt)

![X](/random/arc.png)

  A book set in a dystopian world that did not disappoint. In recent years, the genre for YA dystopian fiction has devolved into poorly executed chosen-one tropes with one-dimensional characters. This series revived my love for the genre and I have not been this engrossed since reading The Hunger Games Trilogy.

### [Cryptonomicon](https://www.amazon.com/Cryptonomicon-Neal-Stephenson-ebook/dp/B000FC11A6/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=cryptonomicon&qid=1597997634&sr=8-1)

  Ideal for erudite history buffs. If you are interested in Mathematics, Cryptography, and History, then you are going to enjoy this a lot despite it being 1000 pages long.

## Arc of a Scythe 

If you like dystopian settings involving AI that are not cheesy (the genre is heavily saturated right now) then you might like this.

The premise is that humanity has advanced to the point of perfection (i.e. no hunger, disease, religions, governments, economic inequality, crime, etc.). Humans have also developed the technology to revive "dead" bodies and reset the age of bodies thereby making everyone immortal. 

To trim the population, an organization comprised of "Scythes" are tasked to kill select people with a quota of 5 people per week. How they kill and who they kill is up to the scythe. This part of humanity, referred to as the Scythedom is completely separate from the state--which is regulated by a nearly omnipresent, all-powerful, all-knowing.... God? Just kidding. It's an AI system called Thunderhead.

You will be reading the book through the perspective of the 2 main protagonists who have both been selected to train as Scythes.

The best parts of the trilogy are:
* World-building
* Moral and ethical dilemmas. How do you define the sanctity of life and the human condition?
* Overall good pacing and writing

## Cryptonomicon

Another recommendation from me to you. If you have time to kill this long weekend, why not give this a shot?

The book follows 3 different storylines. First is that of Lawrence Waterhouse, a guy who lived sometime during the 40s and studied alongside Alan Turing at Princeton. Second is that of Bobby Shaftoe, a US Marine who hated General Douglas MacArthur who also lived during the 40s. Third is that of Randall Waterhouse, Lawrence’s grandson and anti-social run-of-the-mill “Technocrat” (I say this with double quotations because Stephenson actually pokes a lot of fun at the term in the book. I found it really funny because he also poked fun at “academics”). 

As heavily implied by the title, there are a lot of cryptographical and mathematical references in the book because it revolves around The Allied and Axis Powers’ competition to outdo each other in the realm of cryptography and coded messages. Before you yawn and get bored, no, it’s not about Turing cracking the Engima code. In the book, it had already been cracked. 

In the present day, Randy Waterhouse is embroiled in a decades-old conspiracy involving the events that transpired during his grandfather’s and Bobby Shaftore’s time.

* Pros:
1. Set in the Philippines! If you are a history buff--particularly for Philippine History, you might like this.
2. It makes sense. Unlike Dan Brown who likes to slap together buzzwords and pretend what he is saying is accurate. 
3. Good writing and great characterization. In truth, this book is 1000 pages long and a lot of it is spent setting the mood and tone of the time. But because it is well written, it doesn’t get boring. 
4. Cultural commentary. Stephenson pokes fun at a lot of things from Filipino culture to the ridiculous obsession that Hollywood has for Silicon Valley.

* Cons:
1. Complicated. You have to keep track of 3 different stories and you have to figure out how they all intertwine or else you’re just going to be perpetually confused.
2. 1000 pages… Do you guys have that kind of time? A lot of those pages are devoted to world building. Which, I must say, was done fantastically. They say that reading is just you staring at a dead piece of wood and hallucinating for hours on end. I had a lot of fun hallucinating Old Manila. Otherwise, if you are not a visual person, you might find all those pages of world building frustrating
3. You might not agree with Stephenson’s opinions.
4. References to Math. I will say upfront that yes, there are math equations in the book…
