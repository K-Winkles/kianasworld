I have not painted in many years. As a child, I was very very fond of art. My mom was an artist and I kept trying to emulate her style even when it was clear I had my own.

They say that art reflects the artist. Growing up, I hated myself and so I hated my art. I hated how I saw myself in it. 

But now that I am a stable adult, I can look at myself on the canvas and accept whatever it is that I see. 

The great thing about art is that no one will ever expect anything from me. I told everyone that I had no idea how to do art and so if I start doing art again, they are not going to expect much from me.

One of the ironies of my life right now is how I am often celebrated and sometimes feared for my capabilities and drive. But that attention just pushes me to be more and more scared of failure.

Art is a good respite seeing as there is no BUSINESS, CAREER, RELATIONSHIP, OR FAMILY on the line when I do art.

When I do business and when I work, there are always things like REPUTATION and EXPECTATIONS that become both a source of FEAR and MOTIVATION.

And the truth is that it is tiring.
