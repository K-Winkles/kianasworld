# Premise

The premise of the video is that we would react to posts on r/relationship_advice--a subreddit notorious for unique and interesting posts from people seeking relationship advice.

Since the name of my channel is Low Res No Effort, the video is in low resolution (for faster rendering) and there is no effort put into its editing whatsoever.

That way, people will not expect anything from us! :)
