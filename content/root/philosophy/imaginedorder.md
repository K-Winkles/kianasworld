## About the book

**[A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095)** is about humankind's evolution from a biological, social, and cultural standpoint. There are some pretty strong opinions in the book so I would take them with a grain of salt if you do not already have a background in Anthropology. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoy the discussions outline in the book.

## Myths and Imagined Orders

Imagined orders are the binding beliefs, referred to as 'myths', that hold the social order together and enable humans to unify and cooperate in the name of accomplishing great feats.

The biggest and most successful myth would be that of the existence of God. Regardless of whether or not God exists is a separate debate altogether. The Myth of the Existence of God, in this context, refers to the widespread belief in the concept of God.

This enables humans to band together under an imagined order. Today, we call it the Catholic Church.

In fact, another popular imagined order would be that of Democracy. This was perpetuated by the myth of "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness" as detailed in the Declaration of Independence of the United States.

Harari states, "Myths, it transpired; are stronger than anyone could have imagined."

"While human evolution was crawling at its usual snail's pace, the human imagination was building astounding networks of mass cooperation, unlike any other ever seen on earth."

### The Realities of Mass cooperation

Make no mistake, humankind was able to achieve amazing feats because of these networks of mass cooperation. However, "most human cooperation networks have been geared towards oppression and exploitation. The peasants paid for the burgeoning cooperation networks with their precious food surpluses, despairing when the tax collector wiped out an entire year of hard labout with a single stroke of his imperial pen."

## Universal and Eternal Principles of Justice

These beliefs and ideals are blueprints for social order. Both were able to effectively bind humans together with the aim of maintaining a peaceful and productive society.

Both texts claim to outline universal and eternal principles of justice.

### The Code of Hammurabi

The Code of Hammurabi was a collection of laws and judicial decisions which served the purpose of describing how a just ruler should decide.

Take these for example:

* If a superior man should blind the eye of another superior man, they shall blind his eye.

* If he should break the bone of another superior man, they shall break his bone.

* If he should blind the eye of a commoner or break the bone of a commoner, she shall weigh and deliver 60 shekels of silver.

* If he should blind the eye of a slave of a superior man or break the bone of a slave of a superior man, he shall weigh and deliver one-half of the slave's value (in silver).

Most of the points in the Code of Hammurabi follow the same pattern: there is a definite and set heirarchy. Superior men, commoners, and slaves all have different values.

"Hammurabi's Code asserts that Babylonian social order is rooted in universal and eternal principles of justice, dicatated by the gods. The principle of hierarchy is of paramount importance."

### The American Declaration of Independence

Just like the Code of Hammurabi, the American Declaration of Independence claims to have been inspired by some divine order. It asserts that:

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

Note the mention of a creator.

### The Sapiens' Imagination

Hammurabi and the Americans would no doubt be at each other's throats if they were ever together in one room. It would be funny to watch. 

However, the key takeaway here is that both parties fervently agree that what they believe in is a universal and absolute standard. That is simply not true. 

Human rights, democracy, capitalism, religion, materialism, consumerism, etc. are all figments of our imagination. However, just because they are IMAGINED, it does not mean that they are not important.

In fact, these imagined concepts are what holds societies together. Without them, we would devolve into tribes of hunter-gatherers and farmers whose sole goal in life is to survive.

"Voltaire said about God that 'there is no God, but don't tell that to my servant, lest he murder me at night'. Hammurabi would have said the same about his principle of hierarchy and Thomas Jefferson about human rights. Homo sapiens has no natural rights, just as spirders, hyenas, and chimpanzees have no natural rights. But don't tell that to our servants, lest they murder us at night."
