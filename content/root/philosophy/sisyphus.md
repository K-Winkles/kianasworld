## The Absurdity of the Human Condition

![A Sisyphean Meme](/philosophy/sisyphus.jpg)

The Myth of Sisyphus is a philosophical essay by Albert Camus. From the audiobook **[The Dark Side of Human Nature by Professor Daniel Breyer](https://www.audible.com/pd/Understanding-the-Dark-Side-of-Human-Nature-Audiobook/1629977543?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=592f90bd-7f7b-4bfc-afa2-b002e52e7228&pf_rd_r=Q43PZHRSS4YJD4F21Y2G)**:

Existential Anxiety is associated with the potential meaninglessness of human existence. 

Albert Camus states that "There is only one really serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide." 

This is largely due to the absurdity of the human condition. Of course since we are speaking from a Nihilistic perspective, we have to presume that there is no God nor a divine plan--whose primary functions are to provide meaning to life. 

In order to illustrate his point, he cites the Ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus.

## The Myth of Sisyphus

Sisyphus was doomed to an enternity of pushing a boulder up a hill in order to pay for his sins. This is a largely futile attempt because the boulder would roll back down everytime it reached the top.

Thus, the adjective "Sisyphean"--loosely akin to "futile"--was coined.

However, the point of the myth is that Sisyphus' act of defiance of death is ingrained in the very act of eternally pushing the boulder up hill. Thus, for Camus, Sisyphus is the hero of the absurd. He pushes the boulder uphill in the name of defiance yet with no clear end goal in sight.

"To Camus, Sisyphus is 'stronger than his rock'. Additionally, Sisyphus represents everyone, with one small difference: Sisyphus is conscious of the absurdity. In the end, Camus says, we have to imagine that Sisyphus is happy."

## Overcoming absurdity

Camus ultimately states that overcoming existential anxiety is done by taking ownership of our lives. That is, we give our own lives meaning--whether we believe in the existence of God/s or not. 

Ultimately, the Nihilist perspective that we are nothing but specks of dust in the universe still holds true. But the key difference is how we infuse our own lives with meaning--thereby overriding the notion that life is ultimately absurd.
