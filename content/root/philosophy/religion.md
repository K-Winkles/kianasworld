## About the book

**[A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095)** is about humankind's evolution from a biological, social, and cultural standpoint. There are some pretty strong opinions in the book so I would take them with a grain of salt if you do not already have a background in Anthropology. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoy the discussions outlined in the book.

## The Law of Religion: Spiritual Religions

"Today, religion is often considered a source of discrimination, disagreement, and disunion. Yet, in fact, religion has been the third great unifier of humankind, alongside money and empires."

In [the article about Imagined Orders]({{< ref imaginedorder.md >}}), it was stated that everything from democracy to human rights are nothing but figments of our imagination--"Imagined Orders".

However, because these imagined orders are so strong and pervasive, they have become tools to keep the social order amongst us humans. 

One of the most robust imagined orders is Religion. It is common for imagined orders to go out of fashion with time. But because religion has a superhuman element to it, it has a nearly indesctructible legitimacy.

### The Definition of Religion

Harari defines religion as follows:

1. Religion is an entire system of norms and values, rather than an isolated custom or belief.
2. To be considered a religion, the system of norms and values must claim to be based on superhuman laws rather than on human discussions.

**The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist Saints, and in animist ghosts.**

### Universal vs Local Religions

When one thinks of religion, it is common for images of bloody crusades and Jihads in the name of God or Allah to come to mind.

This brand of religion is known as universal and missionary. However, a little known fact is that most of the ancient religions were local and EXCLUSIVE. 

That is, most of the followers of ancient religions had no interest in waging war in the name of converting the human race.

For instance, one example of a local religion is Animism. 

One band of ancient hunter gatherers might believe that Oak Trees are the houses of Gods and therefore must be treated with utmost sanctity and respect.

However, another band of ancient hunter gatherers might believe that Oak Trees are simply just Oak Trees. Perhaps they would rather worship Maple Trees.

That is one example of a Local Religion at work. 

#### The Fall of Local Religions

Local religions worked well before kingdoms and empires were established. These religions only concerned themselves within a few miles radius.

However, with the advent of kingdoms, empires, and larger institutions, Local Religions had to be replaced with Universal Religions.

Religion is nothing but a tool to keep order. And to keep order in a more widespread manner, religion has to become all-encompassing--universal if you will.

### Polytheism Vs. Monotheism

Many religious zealots throughut history have dismissed Polytheism as nothing but primitive and sinful. The irony is that many Monotheistic religions are spin-offs of Polytheistic religions.

For example, the worship of Saints is one such practice in Monotheistic religions that is polytheistic in nature.

![Fundamentalist Meme](/philosophy/fundamentalist.jpg)

#### Polytheism

In the ancient times, people turned to Gods and Goddesses to provide for certain needs such as fertility, abdundant harvests, and security. 

With local religions, the power of Gods only encompassed a certain location. Again, with the advent of Kingdoms and Empires, a need for a more all-encompassing set of Gods and Goddesses were needed.

![Hittite Empire](/philosophy/hittite.png)

Thus, polytheism was born. However, just because polytheism was at one point the pervasive mode of religion, it does not mean animism died out. In fact, animism still remains to be an integral part of many polytheistic religions.

With polytheism, people started to view the "world as a reflection of the relationship between gods and humans."

In essence, if man disobeys the Gods and displeases them, then there will be major consequences such as drought, famine, natural disasters, etc.

Harari stresses that "Polytheism does not necessarily dispute the existence of a single power of law governing the entire universe. In fact, most polytheist and even animist religions recognised such a supreme power that stands behind all the different gods, demons and holy rocks."

In one form of Polytheism, the supreme power is largely uncaring of the mundane matters of humans. Hence, they do not care about human wars, politics, farms, etc.

Instead, one would approach the polytheistic gods to effectively transcend from human to some form of meta-human with none of the polluting characteristics inherent in the common man called "desires".

In another form of Polytheism, gods are intimately concerned with mundane human matters such as harvests, fertility, wars, etc.

Humans can then trade something of value with the god in exchange for their help and support in whatever mundane matter they have. 

**The gist is, "Polytheism is inherently open-minded, and rarely persecutes 'heretics' and 'infidels'".**

#### Death Toll Comparison

"The polytheistic Romans killed no more than a few thousand Christians. In contrast, over the course of the next 1,500 years, Christians slaughtered Christians by the millions to defend slightly different interpretations of the religion of love and compassion."

The Catholics and Protestants have waged countless religious wars against each other on the basis that both parties disagreed on the nature of the love of God.

Protestants were of the belief that God's love was so great that he allowed himself to be tortured and crucified in order to redeem the original sin and allow believers to ascend to heaven.

Meaning, if you are a Protestant and you have professed your belief in God, that alone is enough to ascend to heaven.

On the other hand, Catholics believed that belief in God alone was not enough and it had to be complemented with good deeds.

Protestants took this with great offense because they felt that the Catholic belief implied that Christ's sacrifices were insufficient. 

"On August 23, 152, French Catholics who stressed the importance of good deeds attacked communities of French Protestants who highlighted God's love for humankind. In this attack, the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre, between 5,000 and 10,000 Protestants were slaughtered in less than 24 hours. When the pope in Rome heard the news from France, he was so overcome by joy that he organised festive prayers to celebrate the occasion and commissioned Giorgio Vasari to decorate one of the Vatican's rooms with a fresco of the massacre (the room is currently off limits to visitors)"

#### Monotheism

As was mentioned earlier, polytheism eventually went out of fashion in favor of monotheism.

The first monotheist religion ws born in Egypt, when the Pharaoh Akhenaten declared the god Aten to be the supreme ruler of the entire universe.

Hard as he tried, it did not fly. After he died, people went back to worshipping the old pantheon. 

But the point remains, most of Monotheism is borne out of Polytheism. It is as if humans would worship a set of Gods and then declare one of them to be the ultimate all powerful God.

Because of the very label of a God being the one and only supreme ruler, it has given way to fanatical missionary-ism. Obviously if my God is the one and only ultimate God, then it is my religious duty to show everyone the true path to God. 

This entire logic is exactly why Monotheists are a lot more violent than the more open-minded Polytheists. 

Again, the irony from this is that as Animism survived in Polytheism, Polytheism also survived in Monotheism.

As mentioned earlier, the worship of Saints is a Monotheistic practice which is inherently Polytheistic.

The Christian saints were pretty much the Polytheistic Gods but rehashed to be more palatable to the Christian sensibilities.



### Dualism

Dualism is another birthchild of Polytheism. 

"Dualistic religions espouse the existence of two opposing powers: good and evil. Unlike Monotheism, Dualism believes that evil is an independent power, neither created by the good God, nor subordinate to it. Dualism explains that the entire universe is a battleground between these two forces, and that everything that happens in the world is part of the struggle."

It pretty much solves the Problem of Evil which asks the question: "If God is real, all-powerful, and loving, then why is there evil in the world?"

The Dualistic answer is simplistic yet not as convoluted as the Free Will answer. 

There is evil simply because evil is independent of God, which is Good.

The Free Will answer states that allowing evil to exist is God's way of giving Humans free will.

Again, Free Will espouses a host of questions. However, one thing is clear, Monotheists have always struggled with the Problem of Evil and if they adopted the Dualistic world view, it would solve everything. 

### The Problem of Order

If Dualistic offers a logically sound response to the Problem of Evil, it offers a convoluted answer to the Problem of Order.

"If the world was created by a single God, it's clear why it is such an orderly place, where everything obeys the same laws. But if Good and Evil battle for control of the world, who enforces the laws governing this cosmic war?"

### The Belief to End all Debates

One logical way of solving the riddle is to assume that there is a single omnipotent EVIL God. 

And that's it, the debates have ended. In one fell swoop, this assumption has answered both the Problem of Evil and the Problem of Order.

### The Other Isms

1. Zoroastrianism - The world is one big cosmic battle etween the good god Ahura Mazda and the evil god Angra Mainyu.
2. Gnosticism and Manicheanism - the soul was created by the good god whereas the body was created by the evil god.

## The Law of Nature: Natural Law Religions

In contrast to the aforementioned religions (Spiritual Religions), Natural Religions maintain that there is a superhuman order governing the world and it is a product of natural laws.

Examples of Natural Religions include:

* Jainism
* Buddhism
* Daoism
* Confucianism
* Stoicism
* Cynicism
* Epicureanism

In essence, these religions acknowledged the existence of gods but these gods were still subjected to the laws of nature.

For instance, in Buddhism, it is said that suffering is caused by behaviour patterns of one's own mind. Hence, a person who does not crave cannot suffer. Meaning, the only way to end suffering is to experience reality as it is without craving for it to be any different.

That is, you need to throw away your desires for virtually everything and simply accept things as they come and go. This, according to Buddhism, is how one can free onself from suffering.

This law is known as dharma or dhamma and this is the Buddhist's version of the universal law of nature.

Even then, Natural Law Religions still see the worship of gods or enlightened beings.

With Buddhists, there are enlightened people called Buddhas or bodhisattvas who are supposed to help followers out of their cycle of misery.

At some point however, they also became tools to solve mundane problems--just as the ancient Polytheistic gods were. 


## The Worship of Man: Humanism

Now, Humanism is a birthchild of Natural Law Religion. 

There are different flavors such as:

1. Liberalism
2. Communism
3. Capitalism
4. Nationalism
5. Nazism

Harari states that "If a religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a religion than Islam."

Just like Buddhists, Communists believe in the laws of nature founded by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. 

Just like the bible, Communists have Marx's Das Kapital.

The point is that Marxist laws are superhuman because they r eare supposedly universal truths but they are not supernatural--as compared to the Christian laws.

A typical American as of writing is:

1. A nationalist - they believe in the specialness of their nation
2. A free-market capitalist - they believe this will bring prosperity
3. A liberal humanist - they believe that humans have inalienable rights

Humanists sanctify humanity or Homo Sapiens the same way that Theists sanctify God.

However, Humanity comes in many different flavors and so do Humanists.

![Humanism](/philosophy/humanism.png)

### Liberal Humanism

Liberal Humanists believe that "humanity" is a quality inherent in all individuals. Hence, each individual is sacrosanct.

The way a liberal would decide would be based on whether it aligns with the thought that each human has inalienable rights. So a liberal would typically place importance over an individual's "humanity" over everything else.

This would also explain the liberal opposition to the death penalty and torture. Death penalty and torture deliberately violate the innate rights of individuals. 

What a liberal would instead do is to punish a criminal in the most "humane" way possible in order to protect the human nature of the criminal.

**The liberal belief in the sanctity of human life is a direct descendant of the traditional Christian belief in free and eternal individual souls**. This is necessary because without recoursing to this Traditional Christian Belief, it would be difficult to explain the sanctity of humans.

![Liberals lol](/philosophy/liberal.png)

### Social Humanism

The main difference between Liberal Humanists and Social Humanists is that Socialists believe that "humanity" is collective rather than individualistic.

Yet again, it is the birthchild of the traditional Christian Belief that all souls are equal before God.

Hence, the socialist would place the needs of the collective over the needs of the individual.

I personally find it ironic that rabid socialists also scream human rights when in reality pushing the socialist agenda would no doubt conflict with the agenda for human rights.

For example, they would be fine with ousting a dictator but is the dictator not also human, regardless of any human rights violations they have made?

This just goes to show that one can have a varying range of opinions without completely boxing themselves in to one particular philosophy.

Hence, the rabid socialist would be better labelled as  "mostly socialist with conditional liberal tendencies" and that is perfectly fine. It is only blatant hypocrisy if one would go completely against a belief they claim to subscribe to such as if a rabid socialist were to suddenly choose to become a dictator if given the chance.

![Socialists lol](/philosophy/socialist.jpg)

### Evolutionary Humanism

This is the only humanist sect that is not a spin-off of traditional monotheism. 

"Nazis believed that humankind is not something universal and eternal but rather a mutable species that can evolve or degenerate."

![Nazis lol](/philosophy/nazi.png)

In essence, Nazis believed that mankind had to progress in terms of evolution. The easiest way to do this was to pick out supreme genes. 

They dubbed the Aryan race the most advanced form of humanity because the genes of an Aryan are said to be superior (the confederate states are probably cackling in a swamp reading this).

Hence, every other race/subgroup such as Jews, Roma, homosexuals, the mentally ill, blacks, etc. had to be purged from humankind to ensure its evolution.

Recent studies have debunked the Nazi school of thought that Aryans are genetically superiod--however back in the day there were studies that affirmed that thought.

The birthchild of Nazism is White Supremacy which can be classified under Evolutionary Humanism still.

The irony is that "Nazis did not loathe humanity. They fought liberal humanism, human rights, and Communism precisely because they admired humanity (according to their notions of humanity) and believed in the great potential of the human species."

Today, we see a more liberal spin-off fo Evolutionary Humanism. No one would dare be racist, but people are now interested in dabbling in Biology to create superhumans.
