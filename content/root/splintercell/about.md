## About the game

### IMPORTANT NOTE 

SPLINTER CELL DOUBLE AGENT VERSION 1 IS THE ONLY VERSION I WILL EVER ACKNOWLEDGE. NO TO BASTARDS

While waiting for the PS5 release scheduled this November, I decided to go retro for the meantime. 

Not too long ago, I purchased a 2nd hand original SONY Playstation 2. I also had several, very very LEGAL copies of PS2 games. So very, very legal. Hehehe.

Here it is:

### Background

From the **[Splinter Cell Double Agent wiki](https://splintercell.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Splinter_Cell:_Double_Agent_(Version_1))**:

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent is the fourth installment in the Splinter Cell series of video games developed and published by Ubisoft and endorsed by American author Tom Clancy.

The game follows Third Echelon Splinter Cell Sam Fisher as he assigned to go undercover as a convicted felon in order to infiltrate a domestic terror organization called John Brown's Army (JBA). 

The game begins on September 3, 2007 as Sam Fisher and rookie John Hodge are being flown to Iceland to investigate suspicious activities at a geothermal plant. After Fisher stops the missile launch after John was killed by terrorists, he is met by Colonel Irving Lambert aboard the V-22 Osprey to deliver bad news. Sarah Fisher, Sam's only child, has been killed by a drunk driver. Overcome with grief, he is unable to concentrate on his work and is pulled out of active service. 

### TLDR

Angry white guy who is good at killing people went against the corrupt system and this is him telling his story.

In all seriousness though, Sam Fisher is freaking badass.

## Splinter Cell Chaos Theory

This precedes Double Agent and is also an amazing installment in the series. **[Check it out!](https://splintercell.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Splinter_Cell:_Chaos_Theory)**

{{< youtube B9bn1ooLZJk >}}

In 2007 China and North Korea are unhappy with Japan's new Information Self-Defense Force as they believe it violates Article 9 of the post World War II constitution (there is a news report about the I-SDF in a cutscene in Pandora Tomorrow), which restricts Japan from possessing any armed military force capable of striking outside its own borders. China and North Korea set up a blockade in the Yellow Sea and the United States is forced to respond, as per their agreement with Japan following World War II. They send their most advanced ship, the USS Clarence E. Walsh, into the Yellow Sea hoping China and North Korea will back down.

## A guy who did a long play in 4K 60FPS, video quality I will not be able to attain anytime soon

Sigh. Time to spend dozens of thousands of pesos on a new PC upgrade.
