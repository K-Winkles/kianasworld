# Iceland Footage

So this is footage of me grieving the eye-hand coordination I had when I was 8 years old. This picture pretty much sums it up:

Look at that low res, low poly, shit rendering. Story of my life? 

As a kid I had a few quirky satisfactions I would derive from the game. One of them was knocking guards out, shooting them in the head, and using thermal vision to watch the life ebb away from their bodies.

Watch this loser die in the most pathetic way possible.
