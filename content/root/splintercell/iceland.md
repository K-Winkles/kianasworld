# Iceland Footage

So this is footage of me grieving the eye-hand coordination I had when I was 8 years old. This picture pretty much sums it up:

Look at that low res, low poly, shit rendering. Story of my life? 

As a kid I had a few quirky satisfactions I would derive from the game. One of them was knocking guards out, shooting them in the head, and using thermal vision to watch the life ebb away from their bodies.

# Technically I also have 5 minutes ish worth of footage but...

My internet provider hasn't found it in their hearts to relocate our connection to our new condo. So F. 

I will upload more footage of my misery once I have reconnected with civilization.
