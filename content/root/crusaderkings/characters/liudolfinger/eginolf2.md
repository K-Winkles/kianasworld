![Egninolf II Family Tree](/Eginolf22FamilyTree.png)

## Life Summary

Kaiser Eginolf II was only 6 years old when his dear old father, Kaiser Kuno died. However, little did he know, his father had an extreme yet effective form of family planning and insurance. 

Kaiser Kuno was firm in his belief that if anyone were to inherit the empire, it would have to be his own son. So, Kaiser Kuno, unable to have sons with his wife, pretty much impregnated whoever he could impregnate. This included his vassal's wives. 

Unbenknownst to Kaiser Eginolf II, he had secret half brothers and half sisters amongst the royal families of the Holy Roman Empire. He was also too young to realize that his father had rigged the elections to make sure that Eginolf II would succeed the throne.

His dear old uncle Prince Anselm served as his regent. Prince Anselm was loyal and unambitious, qualities that Kaiser Kuno found desirable. More than that, Prince Anselm was educated and competent despite his lack of ambition. Hence, he was entrusted with Kaiser Kuno's heir.

Everyone was convinced that Kaiser Eginolf II was doomed to fail. He was nothing but a spoiled brat at first, pandered to by nobles and statesmen.
