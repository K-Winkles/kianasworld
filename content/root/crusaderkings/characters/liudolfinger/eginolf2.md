## House Liudolfinger Family Tree Relative to Kaiser Eginolf 2

![Egninolf II Family Tree](/Eginolf22FamilyTree.png)

## Life Summary

Kaiser Eginolf II was only 6 years old when his dear old father, Kaiser Kuno died. However, little did he know, his father had an extreme yet effective form of family planning and insurance. 

Kaiser Kuno was firm in his belief that if anyone were to inherit the empire, it would have to be his own son. So, Kaiser Kuno, unable to have sons with his wife, pretty much impregnated whoever he could impregnate. This included his vassal's wives. 

Unbenknownst to Kaiser Eginolf II, he had secret half brothers and half sisters amongst the royal families of the Holy Roman Empire. He was also too young to realize that his father had rigged the elections to make sure that Eginolf II would succeed the throne.

His dear old uncle Prince Anselm served as his regent. Prince Anselm was loyal and unambitious, qualities that Kaiser Kuno found desirable. More than that, Prince Anselm was educated and competent despite his lack of ambition. Hence, he was entrusted with Kaiser Kuno's heir.

Everyone was convinced that Kaiser Eginolf II was doomed to fail. He was nothing but a spoiled brat at first, pandered to by nobles and statesmen.

## Works in the Hermetic Society

As he grew up however, he turned out to be a lot different than most men in his family. 

For one, he joined the Hermetic Society--fancying himself an erudite scholar, he saw it fitting to pursue matters of intellect.

His first theorem paper was on The Mind of God.

He also took in apprentices. His first apprentice was the Queen of Thuringia.

He eventually rose to become a high ranking official in the Society of Hermetics.

Despite this, he was not free of conflict during his time in the Hermetic Society. He had once been imprisoned by a rival because he was caught breaking into a lab with the aim of destroying his rival's work.

He and his accomplice, a fellow Adept at the time, were not careful with their execution. Hence, he had been imprisoned for nearly a month.

He eventually paid his own ransom--a year's worth of taxes from his Demesne.

### Faith

He was as devout a Catholic as the pope. He was a zealous man who believed in the teachings of the Church. Unlike his secretly Shia kinsmen, he was as pure of religion as a cloistered nun. 

In fact, he went on a Pilgrimage as did his ancestor Kaiser Otto, and came back even more zealous than before (unlike how Kaiser Otto's pilgrimage ended at the time).

Unlike Kaiser Otto, his faith had been strengthened by the pilgrimage.

Though a religious man, he was also a man of science. Interestingly, he was able to marry his love for the spiritual and his love for the empirical.

He went as far as to use his knowledge in Astrology to manipulate the destinies of his children.
