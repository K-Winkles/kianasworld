## Life and Death

Kaiser Emelrich II had been mentored by his grandfather, Kaise Emelrich. So he had been groomed from childhood to accept the Shia faith and eventually join the Society of Assassins. 

However, he died early because he was too much of a glutton. He was known as a jovial patriarch. Since he did not father any sons, he was succeeded by his uncle, Kaiser Kuno Liudolf.
