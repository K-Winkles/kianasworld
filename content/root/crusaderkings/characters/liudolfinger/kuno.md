## House Liudolfinger Family Tree Relative to Kaiser Eginolf

![Kuno Family Tree](/KunoFamilyTree.png)

## Life Summary

Kaiser Kuno was given the Kingdom of Italy by his father Kaiser Eginolf when he was but a young lad. This sharpened his senses and built him into a competent ruler. 

So when Kaiser Emelrich II ate himself to death, council had agreed that Kaiser Kuno, who was the King of Italy at the time, is fit to rule the empire after his nephew.

He was inducted into the society of assassins at some point in time by one of his brothers. At the time of his coronation, he was an adherent.

Unfortunately, he had the same problem that his nephew did. And that was that he did not have any sons. He only had a single daughter which he had married off. 

Hence, he made it his life mission to spread his seed and impregnate as many women as possible in the desperate mission to father a suitable heir.

Eventually, he had so many lovers that he had to break up with them one by one because he could not keep up with the demands of being a womanizer and being an emperor.

That was the only notable thing about him. He loved to make babies and raise those babies. During the last years of his life, he spent his time and money rigging the elections for the next Kaiser.

He had 3 legitimized bastard sons and he forced the realm to accept his first born son Eginolf II as the next Kaiser.

## Death

Though his life was (relatively) peaceful, quietly rising to the rank of Propagandist in the Assassins and cuckolding his vassals, he had the foresight to rig the elections should anything happen to him. This extreme version of "family planning" served him well when he eventually died of an infected wound after quashing a major rebellion.

Alas, his little boy, Eginolf II would forever be remembered as the boy king. He was so keen on insurance that he made sure his loyal, unlanded, and unambitious yet competent and educated cousin Prince Anselm wold be the designated regent should anything happen.
