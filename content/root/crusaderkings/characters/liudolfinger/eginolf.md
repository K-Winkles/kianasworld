## House Liudolfinger Family Tree Relative to Kaiser Eginolf

![Kaiser Eginolf Family Tree](/EginolfFamilyTree.png)

## Life Summary

Right off the bat, Kaiser Eginolf was everything his predecessors were not. For instance, he was:

* A Thrifty Clerk
* A Poet
* Temperate
* Humble
* Gregarious (As was most of the clan members of House Liudolfinger)
* Chaste (Strange for a man of House Liudolfinger)
* Kind
* Diligent
* Paranoid (Surely when one was raised by a family of secret assassins, they are bound to be paranoid)

And since the realm had long been stabilized by his predecessors, he inherited a fairly stable empire. All he had to do was distribute the titles his father had previously given him in order to appease his vassals.

He decided to join the Dominican Order instead of joining the society of Assassins like his brother, father, uncles, grand father, and great grandfather before him.

## Just Kidding, He was a Hypocrite

He was just as hypocritical as any other "devout" Christian. He cuckolded his own son, Prince Anselm.

Not once, but twice! :)

## The Botched Pilgrimage

![Kaiser Eginolf Hypocrite](/Eginolf3.png)

In an effort to practice what he preaches, he decided to embark on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.

But he was sorely disappointed. And so it made him highly cynical.

## Finding Love in a Hopeless Place

Eventually, he decided to join Lucifer's Own...

![Kaiser Eginolf Cultist](/Eginolf7.png)

He did all kinds of evil things like abducting and sacrificing kinsmen, casting curses upon his foes, getting into a weird orgies with fellow cultists, inducting his dear friends into the order...

![Kaiser Eginolf Transformation](/Eginolf9.png)

He was so corrupted that he turned completely mad. His new traits are as follows:

* Thrifty Clerk
* Poet
* Pilgrim
* Frail (A consequence of using his unnatural powers)
* Stutter
* Temperate
* Humble
* Gregarious (The only consistent trait of House Liudolfinger)
* Diligent
* Cynical
* Paranoid
* Cruel
* Depressed (He's been depresed since the botched Pilgrimage)
* Possessed (Obviously)

A far cry from the Eginolf of before. 

## Death 

Eventually, he decided to commit suicide because he had decided that since he bribed everyone into voting for his son in the elections, he could now end his suffering.
