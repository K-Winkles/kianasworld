## House Liudolfinger Family Tree Relative to Kaiser Otto

## Life Summary

Emelrich was crowned Kaiser after his father Liudolf died infirm. He took on the throne at the relatively older age of 39.

The first order of business for any Kaiser is to clean up the mess their predecessor left. With House Liudolfinger, it is common for the ruling emperor to leave a bloody trail and vile reputation before they pass on to the nether world. 

However, unlike his father and grandfather, he was not educated in the ways of Intrigue. Unlike his siblings, he took more into the art of diplomacy. This is likely because at an early age, he was expected to succeed Kaiser Liudolf.

Again, just like his father before him, he found evidence of his father's deep involvement with the assassins...

As part of his induction ritual, he was forced to kill his second born son Liudolf.

On the other hand, his firstborn son and heir King Eginolf of Germany joined the Assassins of his own accord shortly after he joined.

Kaiser Emelrich was considered a tyrant for openly waging war on those who opposed him. For this, the pope excommunicated him. However, shortly after he issued a declaration of repentance and embarrassed himself publicly in order to be welcomed back into the loving embrace of the church, he got excommunicated yet again...

The pope seemed to have enjoyed seeing Emelrich on his knees so much that he wanted Emelrich to do it yet again.

Despite being excommunicated twice, Kaiser Emelrich was an extremely charismatic diplomat. All his vassals adored him despite his being a tyrant and non-member of the church. It helps that the crown has extremely deep pockets and a three generations worth of assassins.

## Later Life Leading Up To Death

During the latter part of his life, he ironically focused on grooming his entire family. Unlike his predecessors, he saw the value of marriage and family ties. So he devoted his later years to raising his children and grandchildren, converting most of them into the Shia faith, and marrying them off into the families of the most powerful vassals in the realm.

His philosophy was: If House Liudolfinger will not hold the Empire forever, then at least House Liudolfinger will be the most premium bloodline with the most premium claims. In fact, he successfully recruited two of his sons into the assassins (at the expense of his other family members). He also converted most of his daughters into the Shia faith.

Kaiser Emelrich's life was relatively peaceful compared to that of his predecessors. This is mostly because his charisma and diplomacy usually sufficed and eliminated the need for a cloak and dagger.

He was able to outlive both Kaiser Otto and Kaiser Liudolf and amazingly lived until the age of 67. This is unheard of for a man of House Liudolfinger.

He was a maimed cripple due to the fact that during one of his assassination missions, he accidentally stabbed his own eye.

Hail Kaiser Emelrich!
