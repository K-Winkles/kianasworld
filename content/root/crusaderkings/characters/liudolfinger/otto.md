## Life Summary

Kaiser Otto is the first Kaiser of the Holy Roman Empire. He was originally King Otto of Germany but after defeating the Italians, he formed the Holy Roman Empire and was thus crowned Kaiser.

He was a member of the society of Assassins and practiced the Shia faith in secret. He eventually rose to the rank of Propagandist (second to the highest rank from Grandmaster). He attempted to convert his own children many times to the Shia faith but was largely unsuccesful.

He was nicknamed "The Spider" because of his deceitful ways. He loved playing dirty. His favorite tactic was to plot murder if there was anyone who would stand in his way.

He whipped his realm into shape by bribing vassals and installing his brothers and sons in the council in order to get the popular vote. He was also a great tactician and solider--exhibiting great martial skill on the field.


## Death


Kaiser Otto eventually died a villified man. Everyone thought he was raving mad and everyone knew he was a murderer, kinslayer, and tyrant.

Everyone who had ever stood in his way paid dearly! But he launched his House's name into legendary status. It was House Liudolfinger that fell the mightly Kingdom of Italy, usurped Rome, and formed the Holy Roman Empire. 

Though he never reached Grandmaster Status in the Society of Assassins, his son and heir, Kaiser Liudolf did. Liudolf eventually succeeded where Otto had failed. He had groomed one of his sons to be his protege and successfully converted many of his children into following the great cause.

Hail Kaiser Otto!
