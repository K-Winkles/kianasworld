# Rationale

As a byproduct of my responsibilities as the Data Engineer in charge of the company's Data Center, I produced this simple utility package specialized for data centers.

At the moment of writing, it only contains batch move scripts. However, in the future, I will be adding batch CRUD and cross-bucket scripts.
